#doc (Manual) "The future-work Branch" =>

tag := "sec-future"
%%%

The development has two branches. The `metatheory` branch covers MeTTa as it stands today: the
minimal-MeTTa kernel and standard library, validated against Hyperon's corpus, with the machine-checked
metatheory, the published operational-semantics model, the distributed atomspace proof target, and no
`sorry`. The `future-work` branch prototypes the directions the minimal-MeTTa specification lists under
"future work", together with a fuller module system. A feature is admitted to the branch only once the
metatheory still goes through, or its interaction with the metatheory is documented precisely.

# A Feature, and a Finding

The first feature on the branch is match-by-equality, written `(:= x)`, which the specification lists as
"syntax to match an atom by equality". Inside `unify`, the pattern `(:= x)` matches by structural
equality rather than by unification: the `then` branch is taken exactly when the queried atom equals `x`
under the current bindings, and no new variable bindings are produced. So `(unify $a (:= Empty) then
else)` takes the `else` branch for a free `$a`, whereas ordinary `unify` would bind `$a` to `Empty`. The
feature is implemented in `unifyOp`, and the full build passes the corpus at 270 of 270.

The feature was first prototyped in the general matcher `matchAtomsWith`, and the machine-checked proofs
caught a design problem. A `(:= x)` left-hand side can fire on a query with a different head, so such a
rule no longer belongs in its head's first-argument-indexing bucket. This contradicts the
indexing-soundness theorem of {ref "sec-meta"}[the metatheory] (`matchAtoms_headKey`, "matching forces
head agreement"). Preserving the theorem would require either bucketing by the head of `x`, which is
sound only when `x` is symbol-headed, or treating every `(:= x)` rule as head-less, which is sound but
skips indexing for those rules. The specification's intended feature, a modifier scoped to `unify`,
avoids the problem. The proofs caught this before any test did.

# The Roadmap

The branch records the remaining items from the specification's future-work section. Each item is
annotated with its interaction with the existing metatheory.

 * *Gap matching* `(A ... D ...)`, which matches part of an expression with holes. Like `(:= x)`,
   this is a matcher-level feature whose interaction with first-argument indexing must be worked out,
   since a gap pattern's head may not determine its bucket.
 * *Explicit atomspace variable bindings*, making the interpreter's implicit bindings explicit
   everywhere. Per the specification this would allow `eval` to be defined in terms of `unify`,
   enabling user-programmable chaining strategies. It requires a deep refactor of the interpreter
   core.
 * *General matching modifiers* `(:mod atom)`, the specification's proposed syntax for adding
   matching directives, of which `:=` is the first, without clashing with user symbols.
 * *A fuller module system*. Beyond the namespaced `import!` and `register-module!` already on the
   `metatheory` branch, this covers the `import * from`, `import as`, and `import item from` forms,
   package metadata with version selection, and the catalog-management operations.
