This chapter states what LeaTTa establishes, what it does not yet establish, and how it relates to prior
work.

# What Is Established

LeaTTa gives you an executable minimal-MeTTa kernel and standard library that pass Hyperon's test corpus
at 270 of 270 assertions. It also gives proof targets where every theorem is checked by Lean's kernel
with no `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide`, `partial`, or `unsafe`. The public audit files report only
the three standard classical axioms of Mathlib where those library paths require them.

The metatheory proves determinism, confluence of the deterministic fragment, soundness and completeness
of first-argument indexing, gradual-type soundness, non-transitivity of consistency for both the
relation and the executable matcher, binding and atomspace visibility laws, observation and host-law
boundaries, distributed delivery and convergence boundaries, and a bisimulation tying the indexed
kernel to the published operational semantics at the level of rule firing.

# Current Limitations

Here are four boundaries, each stated plainly, each a candidate for the next increment of work.

 * *The kernel matcher's equality oracle.* Because MeTTa atoms embed IEEE floating-point grounded
   values, structural equality on atoms cannot be a lawful `BEq` ({ref "sec-types"}[the float caveat]
   in the object-language chapter). The development never assumes `LawfulBEq Atom`, but several
   matcher lemmas are phrased around a structural-equality oracle rather than a single canonical
   equality. Refactoring the matcher to a structural-bit equality that is lawful by construction,
   with the float comparison isolated, would simplify those proofs.
 * *The typing judgment to kernel bridge.* The well-typedness judgment used in the preservation
   results is a standalone declarative judgment. A lemma connecting it to the kernel's own
   `get-type` computation would make subject reduction speak directly about the types the running
   interpreter reports.
 * *The full query operation.* As noted in {ref "sec-correspondence"}[the correspondence chapter],
   `KernelStep` is the indexed rule-firing core; rule-variable freshening, ambient-binding merge,
   and cyclic-substitution pruning are abstracted out. A lemma relating `queryOp` to `KernelStep`
   up to the existing α-equivalence setoid would lift the bisimulation from the rule-firing core to
   the complete query operation.
 * *The gas model's outcome classification.* The resource-bounded extension proves that energy is
   never created. It does not yet classify a halted configuration as completed, out of gas, or stuck,
   nor prove that a strictly-positive per-step cost yields termination within a fixed budget. The
   ingredients are present; a three-way outcome type would complete the on-chain metering story.

None of these limitations contradicts a stated result. Each marks where a stated result can be
strengthened or its scope widened.

# Related Work

The type-system layer follows the gradual-typing tradition of {citet siekTaha}[], adopting their
consistency relation and extending their non-transitivity result to the executable matcher. The
operational layer is a machine-checked rendering of the MeTTa operational semantics of {citet mops}[],
which its authors propose as an independent specification of the language. The motivation for that
specification and for a language of thought built on metagraph rewriting is given by
{citet goertzelMetagraph}[]. The development uses Lean 4 {citep lean4}[] and draws on Mathlib
{citep mathlib}[] for order-theoretic and relational infrastructure.

# Conclusion

LeaTTa shows that MeTTa's minimal interpreter, its gradual type system, and the published operational
semantics can be expressed in one machine-checked development. It also shows that the optimisations a
production evaluator relies on can be proved faithful to the specification. The limitations above mark
where the next increments of work can extend that scope.
