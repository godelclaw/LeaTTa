Module: MettaHyperonFull.Core.Matching
Layer: Core
Purpose: Nondeterministic pattern matching for MeTTa atoms and the consistency-checking merge of
  binding sets. Matching follows the official left/right style: variables on either side produce
  bindings, expressions match pointwise, and a runtime-supplied custom matcher handles grounded atoms.
  Merge combines two binding sets into all their consistent unions (Hyperon's `Bindings::merge`), using
  unification to reconcile conflicting values.

Main exports: GroundMatcher, Bindings.addVarBinding, Bindings.addVarEquality, Bindings.mergeOne,
