Module: MettaHyperonFull.Core.FreeVars
Layer: Core
Purpose: The free variables of an atom, kept as a named notion for the metatheory. Atoms have no
  binders, so the free variables are exactly the variable occurrences (`Atom.vars`). Also gives the
  closedness (ground) predicate and a small proof about it.
Imports: MettaHyperonFull.Core.Atom
Trusted boundary: none
Main exports: freeVars, isGround, isGround_sym
Open obligations: none
