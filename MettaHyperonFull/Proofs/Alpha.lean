Module: MettaHyperonFull.Proofs.Alpha
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: α-equivalence of atoms, defined as equality of canonical forms. Proves it is an equivalence
  relation, that it preserves atom size, and that it collapses to syntactic equality on variable-free
  atoms. Documents why the kernel's Boolean decider is faithful only on the float-free fragment,
  because host IEEE floats make BEq Atom unlawful.

# Metatheory: α-equivalence

MeTTa's variables are first-order *query* variables with **atom-global scope**; there are no
binders, hence none of the local scoping of the λ-calculus. Two atoms are α-equivalent when one
is obtained from the other by a consistent renaming of variables. The kernel decides this by
canonicalising variable names in first-occurrence order (`canonicalizeVars`) and comparing
(`alphaEq`, in `Core/Alpha.lean`), matching Hyperon's `atoms_are_equivalent`.

Three facts are proved here:

* `alphaEq_equivalence`:      α-equivalence (equal canonical forms) is an **equivalence relation**;
* `AlphaEq.size_eq`:          α-equivalent atoms have the **same size** (renaming cannot change shape);
* `alphaEq_iff_eq_of_closed`: on **variable-free** atoms, α-equivalence collapses to syntactic `=`.

## The Boolean decider and host floats

We state α-equivalence *propositionally* as
`AlphaEq a b := canonicalizeVars a = canonicalizeVars b`, rather than through the kernel's
Boolean `alphaEq`. `Atom` contains `Ground.float : Float → Ground`, and
Lean's `Float` equality is IEEE 754: `nan == nan` is `false`, and `0.0 == (-0.0)` is `true` while
`0.0 ≠ -0.0`. The derived `BEq Atom` is therefore **not lawful** (`LawfulBEq Atom` is false), so
the Boolean `alphaEq` is not reflexive on atoms containing `NaN`. `#eval` confirms
`alphaEq (gnd (float (0.0/0.0))) (gnd (float (0.0/0.0))) = false`, and it conflates `±0.0`. The
Boolean is the correct decision procedure for `AlphaEq` on the float-free fragment; the
propositional relation is an equivalence relation unconditionally. Hyperon inherits the same
host-float behavior, so the propositional form is faithful to the implementation.

/-- Propositional α-equivalence: two atoms are α-equivalent when they share a canonical form, i.e.
are equal up to a consistent renaming of their (atom-global, unscoped) query variables. The
kernel's Boolean `alphaEq` decides this relation on the float-free fragment; see the module
docstring for the host-float caveat. -/
