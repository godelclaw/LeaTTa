Layer: Proofs
Purpose: Subject reduction (type preservation) for MeTTa's user-defined =-rewriting, the central
  type-soundness theorem. Reconstructs a compositional typing judgment WT over the space's (: a T)
  declarations, proves the substitution lemma WT.subst (typing stable under a context-grounding
  substitution), and concludes reduction_preserves_type: for a type-preserving rule (= L R) and any
  grounding σ, the redex σL and contractum σR both have the rule's type T. The type-preserving-rule
  hypothesis is the formal statement that the programmer wrote a well-typed rule.
Imports: MettaHyperonFull.Proofs.Substitution
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: WT, WTArgs, mkArrow, Grounds, WT.subst, WTArgs.subst, reduction_preserves_type
Open obligations: none. Preservation holds over a fixed signature, so reflective programs that
  rewrite their own :/<: facts are out of scope, as the scope note records.

# Metatheory: subject reduction (type preservation) for user-defined rewriting

`Proofs/TypeSoundness.lean` proved preservation only for the *grounded* core; this file proves
**type preservation for MeTTa's user-defined `=`-rewriting**.

MeTTa has *no published type calculus or soundness theorem*. Both the Hyperon whitepaper and the
"Reflective Metagraph Rewriting" paper say the type system is the operational `get_atom_types` and
that a formal preservation result is future work. We reconstruct a **compositional typing
judgment** `WT`, a standalone declarative typing relation for MeTTa's user rewriting. It uses the
same `(: a T)` data source as `Core.HasType` but is independent of the kernel's operational
`getTypes`/`typeMismatch`; subject reduction is proved for this declarative discipline. The
judgment comprises a context `Γ` for rule variables, the space's `(: a T)` declarations, arrow
elimination for application (`WT.app`), and subtyping with a gradual top (`WT.sub`, since
`TypeEnv.inherits _ _ Atom` and `… %Undefined%` hold). The key step is the substitution lemma
(`WT.subst`): typing is stable under a substitution that grounds the variable context.

`reduction_preserves_type` follows directly. A MeTTa rewrite step fires a rule `(= L R)` by
matching a redex against `L`, binding `σ`, and rewriting to `σ R`, as in Hyperon's `interpret`.
If the rule is type-preserving (`L` and `R` share a type `T` under `Γ`), then for any grounding
`σ` both `σ L` and `σ R` have type `T`.

Assumption: the type-preserving-rule hypothesis is stated explicitly. MeTTa does not check
`type(L) = type(R)` when a rule is asserted (equality inference is deferred to the interpreter
loop), so the caller must supply this assumption. It is the formal analogue of "the programmer
wrote a well-typed rule."

## Scope

* **Fixed signature.** `Γ` and `env` are fixed across the step. MeTTa's reflection (programs
  rewriting their own `:`/`<:` facts) is out of scope. Preservation holds for the fragment that
  reduces against a settled signature.
* **Set-valued typing.** MeTTa's `get_atom_types` returns a *set* (no principal type); `WT _ _ a T`
  is "`T` is *one* of `a`'s types". Preservation is existential over that set, matching the
  operational reading.
* The gradual wildcards `%Undefined%` and `Atom` enter through `WT.sub`, since both are universal
  supertypes under `TypeEnv.inherits`.
