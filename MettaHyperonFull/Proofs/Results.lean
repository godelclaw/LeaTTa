Purpose: The abstract machine is deterministic. interpretStack1, interpretFuel, and mettaEval are
  total functions of their inputs, so every configuration has a unique successor and a unique result.
  MeTTa's nondeterminism is reified in the returned list, not left as don't-know nondeterminism in
  the transition relation, which is the replayable discipline a blockchain VM needs. Also records the
  driver's base cases, accumulator correctness, and the cartesian branching-factor law.

# Metatheory: the abstract machine is deterministic

For use as an on-chain / smart-contract language, MeTTa execution must be **predictable**: the
same program in the same state must always produce the same outcome.

The minimal interpreter is a *deterministic* abstract machine. One step,
`interpretStack1 : MinEnv → Nat → St → Item → List Item × St`, and the driver
`interpretFuel : … → List (Atom × Bindings) × St` are **total functions** of their inputs, so
every configuration has a unique successor and a unique result. MeTTa's nondeterminism (a query
may yield several results) is *reified in the returned `List`*: it is data the function computes,
not "don't-know" nondeterminism in the transition relation. That is the discipline a
blockchain VM needs: replayable, with all branching observable in the output rather than hidden in
evaluation order.

The module records that determinism explicitly, the definitional base cases of the driver, and
the law governing `cartesian`, the helper that forms the product of the (nondeterministic)
argument-evaluation results in `mettaEval`.

/-- **Determinism of one step.** `interpretStack1` is a function, so a configuration steps to a
unique successor multiset-of-items and a unique threaded state, so the transition relation it
induces is single-valued. -/

    {r₁ r₂ : List Item × St} (h₁ : interpretStack1 env fuel st it = r₁)
    (h₂ : interpretStack1 env fuel st it = r₂) : r₁ = r₂ :=
  h₁.symm.trans h₂

/-- **Determinism of the driver.** `interpretFuel` is a function: a program run to a fuel bound
yields a unique result list and final state. -/
theorem interpretFuel_deterministic {env : MinEnv} {fuel : Nat} {st : St} {work : List Item}
    {done : List (Atom × Bindings)} {r₁ r₂ : List (Atom × Bindings) × St}
    (h₁ : interpretFuel env fuel st work done = r₁)
    (h₂ : interpretFuel env fuel st work done = r₂) : r₁ = r₂ :=
  h₁.symm.trans h₂

/-- **Determinism of full evaluation.** `mettaEval` is a function of its inputs. -/
theorem mettaEval_deterministic {env : MinEnv} {fuel : Nat} {st : St} {bnd : Bindings} {a : Atom}
    {r₁ r₂ : List (Atom × Bindings) × St} (h₁ : mettaEval env fuel st bnd a = r₁)

/-- With no work left, the driver returns the accumulated results (un-reversed) and the unchanged
state, at any fuel. -/
theorem interpretFuel_nil (env : MinEnv) (fuel : Nat) (st : St)
    (done : List (Atom × Bindings)) : interpretFuel env fuel st [] done = (done.reverse, st) := by
  cases fuel <;> simp [interpretFuel]

/-- When fuel is exhausted with work remaining, the driver harvests *every* item: already-final
items yield their result, and each unfinished item yields a `StackOverflow` error (`exhaustedPair`), so
exhaustion is reported, never silently truncated. -/
theorem interpretFuel_zero_cons (env : MinEnv) (st : St) (it : Item) (rest : List Item)
    (done : List (Atom × Bindings)) :
    interpretFuel env 0 st (it :: rest) done
      = (done.reverse ++ (it :: rest).map (fun i => if isFinal i then finalPair i else exhaustedPair i), st) := by
  simp [interpretFuel]

/-- **Accumulator correctness.** The `done` accumulator threaded through the driver is exactly a
reversed prefix of the output: `interpretFuel … work done` equals
`done.reverse ++ (interpretFuel … work []).1` with the same final state. So the accumulator never
changes *which* results are produced: it is a faithful accumulator, which is what lets us reason
about the driver as if it simply returned its results. (Induction on `fuel`; the inductive step
rewrites both occurrences of the recursive call by the inductive hypothesis and reconciles the
`reverse`/`append` bookkeeping.) -/
