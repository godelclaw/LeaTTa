Module: MeTTaIL.Calculi.Lambda
Layer: Calculi
Purpose: Simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) with de Bruijn indices, the binder-calculus
  type-soundness companion to `MeTTaIL/Calculi/SKI.lean`. SKI handles the binder-free case, where
  typing and reduction are first-order; here the calculus has a binder (`lam`), so reduction needs
  capture-avoiding substitution and typing needs a context. A `var i` is the binder `i` levels out, the
  typing context `Γ : List Ty` lists the binder types innermost first, and `var i` looks up `Γ[i]?`. The
  two soundness results are the standard pair: `preservation` (subject reduction) says reduction keeps
  the type, resting on a substitution lemma and a context-weakening lemma; `progress` says a closed,
  well-typed term is a value (a `lam`) or can take a step, so it never gets stuck. The de Bruijn index
  arithmetic is handled with `omega` and the core `List.getElem?`/`List.insertIdx` lemmas.

deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- de Bruijn shift (lifting): add `d` to every free variable whose index is at least the cutoff `c`.
    Crossing a `lam` raises the cutoff by one, because that binder introduces a new index 0 and pushes
    the outer variables out by one. This is the weakening operation on terms. -/

/-- Capture-avoiding single-variable substitution `t[j := s]`: replace the variable with index `j` by
    `s`, drop the indices above `j` by one (they lose the binder that `j` named), and leave the indices
    below `j` alone. Crossing a `lam` raises the target index to `j+1` and shifts `s` up by one so its
    free variables still point at the same binders. -/

/-- The typing relation, with a de Bruijn context `Γ : List Ty` (the binder types, innermost first).

### Weakening

Inserting a fresh binding of type `A` at position `c` of the context, and shifting the term's free
variables across that new binder, preserves typing. The proof is an induction on the typing
derivation; the only real work is the `var` case, where the cutoff `c` splits the index into the part
below `c` (untouched) and the part at or above `c` (shifted up by one), matched by the core
`List.insertIdx` lookup lemmas.

### Substitution

If `s` has type `A` in `Γ`, and `t` has type `B` in the context `Γ` with `A` inserted at position
`j`, then `t[j := s]` has type `B` in `Γ`. The induction is on the term `t`, generalizing the context,
the position `j`, the substituend `s`, and the result type `B` (all of these change under the `lam`
case). The `var` case is again the heart of it: the index is below, equal to, or above the inserted
slot, handled by the three `List.insertIdx` lookup lemmas plus `omega`.

### Soundness

`preservation` is subject reduction: a step keeps the type. The beta case is the substitution lemma;
the three congruence cases recurse. `progress` says a closed well-typed term is a value or steps, so
typing rules out stuck closed terms.
-/

/-- Subject reduction (type preservation): a single reduction step preserves the type. The context is
    generalized because the `lam` congruence rule descends under a binder, extending the context. -/
theorem preservation {t t' : Tm} (hs : Step t t') :
    ∀ {Γ : List Ty} {T : Ty}, HasTy Γ t T → HasTy Γ t' T := by
  induction hs with
  | beta =>
      intro Γ T ht

  | lam _ ih =>
      intro Γ T ht
      cases ht with
      | lam hbody => exact .lam (ih hbody)

/-- Progress: a closed, well-typed term is either a value (a `lam`) or it can take a step. So a closed
    well-typed term is never stuck. The induction is on the typing derivation in the empty context; the
    `var` case is impossible (no variable types in the empty context) and the `app` case branches on
    whether the function part is already a value, exposing a beta redex, or can step. -/

      rcases ihf rfl with hfval | ⟨f', hf'⟩
      · -- the function is a value, hence a `lam`, so the application is a beta redex.
        match f, hfval, hf with

      · -- the function steps, so the application steps on its left.

### Examples

A few concrete closed terms exercising the two theorems. We write `idTm` for the identity at a chosen
type and reduce `(λ x. x) (λ y. y)`.
-/

/-- The identity function at type `T -> T`: `λ (x : T). x`. -/
def idTm (T : Ty) : Tm := .lam T (.var 0)

/-- The identity is well typed at `T -> T` in any context. -/
example (T : Ty) : HasTy [] (idTm T) (.arr T T) :=
  .lam (.var rfl)

/-- `(λ x. x) (λ y. y)` at base type `0`: the outer identity expects an argument of type `b0 -> b0`,
    and the inner identity supplies one. -/
example :
    HasTy [] (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)))
      (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0)) :=
  .app (.lam (.var rfl)) (.lam (.var rfl))

/-- That application beta-reduces to the inner identity. The substitution `(var 0)[0 := idTm _]`
    computes to `idTm _`. -/
example :
    Step (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)) := by
  have h : Step (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)))
      ((Tm.var 0)[0 := idTm (.base 0)]) := .beta
  simpa [subst, idTm] using h

/-- Preservation in action: the reduct keeps the type `b0 -> b0`. -/
example
    (ht : HasTy [] (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)))
      (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) :
    HasTy [] (idTm (.base 0)) (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0)) := by
  have hstep : Step (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)) := by
    have h : Step (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)))
        ((Tm.var 0)[0 := idTm (.base 0)]) := .beta
    simpa [subst, idTm] using h
  exact preservation hstep ht

/-- Progress in action: the well-typed redex `(λ x. x) (λ y. y)` is not a value, so progress gives a
    step. -/
example :
    ∃ t', Step (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0))) t' := by
  have ht : HasTy [] (.app (idTm (.arr (.base 0) (.base 0))) (idTm (.base 0)))
