Module: MeTTaIL.Theory.Rename
Layer: Theory
Purpose: Category renaming and constructor relabeling, the traversals behind the `addExports` rename
  and `addReplacements`. A `RenameExport old new` renames a sort `old` to `new` everywhere it occurs in
  the presentation (the correct rename; the section note records where Scala's buggy `RenameExport`
  differs, and `MeTTaIL/HYPERON_IMPROVEMENTS.md` lists those bugs for upstream). A `Replacement [perm]
  target . cat => newDef` swaps the rule labelled `target` for `newDef` and, in every equation and
  rewrite, relabels each applied `target` to `newDef`'s label while permuting its arguments by `perm`
  (Scala `updateAST`). The traversals over `Cat` and `AST` are hand-written by mutual recursion because
  both nest through `List` (`prod` and `sexp`).

/-! ### Category replacement (sort renaming)

This is the CORRECT sort rename: replace the generating sort `old` by `new` everywhere it occurs, the
exports, every rule's output sort (only where it mentions `old`), the item sorts (recursing into the
compound sorts `arrow`/`prod`/`listOf` and into abstraction bodies), the sorts carried by list labels,
and the list-label sorts inside equations and rewrites.

Scala `handleAddExports`'s `RenameExport` branch is buggy in ways we deliberately do NOT reproduce; the
formalization does the correct thing and the bugs are recorded for upstream in
`MeTTaIL/HYPERON_IMPROVEMENTS.md`. In short: `updateDef` sets every rule's output sort to `new`
unconditionally, `replaceCats` and the export map are shallow (they miss a sort nested in a compound
sort), and the rename touches only `listcat_`/`listdef_`, leaving stale list-label sorts in rule
labels, equations, and rewrites. The Rholang oracle is unaffected because its one rename is flat
(`Elem -> Proc`, on a presentation whose every rule already has output sort `Elem`, no compound sorts
or list labels), so the correct and buggy renames coincide there.
