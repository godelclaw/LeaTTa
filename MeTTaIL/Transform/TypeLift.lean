Module: MeTTaIL.Transform.TypeLift
Layer: Transform
Purpose: The Hypercube type-lift pass (`--hypercube`), the untyped-to-typed transformation of
  `transformation.md`, restricted to the part the Scala tool actually implements. For each function
  symbol it adds a `TypeLiftCC<L>DD` companion (the "type of L") whose arity is the type-lift `T` of the
  original arity: T(G) = G, T(A -> B) = T(A) x (T(A) -> T(B)), T(A x B) = T(A) x T(B), T([A]) = [T(A)].
  Rules with raw binders are skipped (the desugared `...ToArrow` form is lifted instead). After the
  lift, the duplication rule fires: when a variable occurs as a direct argument two or more times across
  the constructor applications in a rewrite's left-hand side, each hosting constructor's companion gains
  an extra argument of that variable's category. The modal possibility types of `transformation.md` are
  not generated here, exactly as in the Scala code (that step is commented out), so the pass is faithful
  to the tool, not to the full design note.

/-- Whether a rule carries a raw binder of either kind. The Scala `--hypercube` pass
    (`Hypercube.scala`) skips such a rule for both `BindNTerminal` and `AbsNTerminal` items, unlike the
    desugar pass, which keys on `BindNTerminal` alone (`Rule.hasBind`). -/

/-- The category of the argument an item contributes in a term: a non-terminal's category, a binder's
    category, or, for an abstraction, the innermost non-abstraction category. `Rule.typeLiftDef` skips
    any rule with a raw binder, so its use of `argCats` sees only binder-free rules. `extrasForLHS` may
    also read `argCats` on a bindered host rule (see `companionLabelOf`), where the `bindNTerminal` arm
    applies. Known divergence there: Scala `optCatFromItem` maps a `BindNTerminal` to `IdCat(name)`, not
    to its category; the tested calculi never index a `BindNTerminal` position with a repeated
    left-hand-side variable, so this arm is unreached here. -/

/-- The extra companion arguments contributed by one rewrite's left-hand side: when a variable occurs
    as a direct argument two or more times across the constructor applications, each hosting
    constructor's companion gains an argument of that variable's category. We count direct-argument
    occurrences, so a variable repeated inside one constructor counts each occurrence; Scala counts
    distinct constructor nodes (`freeVarsInAST` returns a set keyed by structural node equality, so two
    structurally identical hosting constructors collapse to one). The two agree when each repeated
    variable spans distinct, non-identical constructors, as in the comm example. Only base (unqualified)
    variables participate, matching the matcher's variable model. -/
