Module: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Context
Layer: Semantics
Purpose: The one-step rewrite relation closed under context, the standard reduction relation of the
  presentation's rewrite system, together with an executable one-step reducer. `RewStep` closes the
  existing top-level `Reduces` under `sexp`-argument and `Subst` contexts. `oneStep` searches
  leftmost-outermost for a redex: it tries a base rewrite at the root, and if none applies it descends
  left to right into the arguments, then into the `Subst` components. The headline is `oneStep_sound`:
  every step the executable reducer takes is a genuine `RewStep`, which reuses the matcher soundness
  `reduces_of_applyBaseRewrite`. Strategy note: leftmost-outermost is sound always, and by O'Donnell's
  theorem it is normalizing for left-normal orthogonal systems such as combinatory logic; finding a
  normal form for a general system needs parallel-outermost, which is future work.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Relation
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: RewStep, oneStep, oneStepList, reduces_of_mem_baseReducts, oneStep_sound,
  oneStepList_sound
Open obligations: completeness (that `oneStep` finds a redex whenever one exists) holds for left-normal
  orthogonal systems; the general normalizing strategy (parallel-outermost) is future work.
