Module: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Strategy
Layer: Semantics
Purpose: Evaluation-context strategies, the K-framework style of strictness. A strategy says, for each
  operator and argument position, whether the reducer may descend there. `oneStepStrat` is the
  leftmost-outermost reducer restricted to the strategy's positions: it tries a base rewrite at the root,
  then descends only into the strategy-allowed argument positions (left to right), and into the Subst
  components. Restricting where the reducer looks only prunes the search, so soundness is inherited:
  `oneStepStrat_sound` shows every step it takes is a genuine `RewStep`. The all-positions strategy
  recovers the unrestricted reducer (`oneStepStrat_all`), so this is a faithful generalization of
  `oneStep`.
