Module: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Relation
Layer: Semantics
Purpose: The GSLT reduction relation, where a presentation's rewrites induce reduction on terms.
  `Reduces p t t'` holds when some rewrite of `p` fires on `t`: its conclusion's left-hand side matches
  `t` (binding the pattern variables), each premise `src ~> tgt` requires the bound `src` subterm to
  itself reduce (binding `tgt` to the reduct), and the contractum is the conclusion's right-hand side
  instantiated with the bindings. Base rewrites (no premises) reduce a redex directly; premised rewrites
  are the congruence/context rules (par1, par2, RNew, and so on). The relation builds on the executable
  matcher and instantiator of `Semantics/Reduce.lean`, giving the precise sense in which presentations
  of GSLTs describe the operational semantics of computational calculi. The final theorem is a
  soundness result: every reduct the executable `applyBaseRewrite` produces is a genuine one-step
  reduction. Mathlib-free.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Reduce
Trusted boundary: human-reviewed spec
Main exports: Reduces, PremisesHold, ReducesMany, ReducesMany.trans, reduces_base,
  reduces_of_applyBaseRewrite
Open obligations: the converse of the soundness theorem (completeness, that every reduction is produced
  by the matcher) is not proved.
