Module: MeTTaILTests.Reduce
Layer: Tests
Purpose: Reduction examples, checked by computation. The cases cover the I and K (second-step)
  combinator rules and an RComm step that exercises the built-in `Subst`, confirming the matching,
  substitution, and rewrite-application core. Mismatched rules are checked to yield no reduct.
  Results are compared with `BEq` (`==`) because `AST` carries `BEq`, not `DecidableEq`.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Reduce, MeTTaIL.Semantics.Relation
Trusted boundary: none
Main exports: example checks of applyBaseRewrite (iota1, kappa2, rcomm) and a Reduces witness on
  concrete terms; no reusable definitions.
Open obligations: none
