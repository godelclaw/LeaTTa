Module: MeTTaILProofs.SubjectReduction
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: The matching half of the substitution lemma, and subject reduction for the recursive sort
  system of `Semantics/WellSorted`. `WellSorted.inst_wellSorted` gives the inst half (instantiating a
  well-sorted term with a well-sorted substitution stays well-sorted); here we prove the matching half:
  matching a well-sorted subject against a well-sorted pattern produces a well-sorted substitution. The
  two halves combine into `subjectReduction_base`: a base rewrite whose two sides are well-sorted under a
  shared context keeps the subject well-sorted, so every subterm stays at its declared sort across a
  contraction. That preservation then lifts through the runtime's one-step relation `RewStep` and the
  many-step `RewStepMany` (`rewStep_preserves_wellSorted`, `rewStepMany_preserves_wellSorted`): the
  congruence cases hold structurally, and the `Subst` cases are vacuous because a well-sorted term is
  subst-free. So subject reduction holds along the whole reduction relation, given that base contractions
  preserve sorts (which `subjectReduction_base` supplies). This is the deep type-soundness result for the
  generic runtime, beyond the head-sort preservation of `Semantics/Sorts`. The matcher inversion
  `matchPat_sexp_head` (from `SortSoundness`) and `LawfulBEq AST`/`Label` (from `DecEq`) read the matcher's
  `==`.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.WellSorted, MeTTaILProofs.SortSoundness (matchPat_sexp_head, demoPres),
  MeTTaILProofs.DecEq (LawfulBEq)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: varsOf, LabelDeterminesRule, WSsub, matchPat_wssub, matchPat_cover, subjectReduction_base,
  rewStep_preserves_wellSorted, rewStepMany_preserves_wellSorted
Open obligations: the top-level hypothesis of the lifting (that base reductions of the `Reduces` relation,
  including premised rewrites, preserve sorts) is discharged by `subjectReduction_base` for premise-free
  well-sorted rules; binder/`Subst` handling (the first-order fragment is complete).

The two halves combine: matching gives a well-sorted substitution (`matchPat_wssub`) that covers every
pattern variable (`matchPat_cover`), and instantiation preserves well-sortedness (`inst_wellSorted`). So a
base rewrite whose two sides are well-sorted under a shared context, applied to a well-sorted subject,
yields a well-sorted result at the same sort. -/

Subject reduction lifts from base contractions to the runtime's full one-step `RewStep` and many-step
`RewStepMany`. The congruence case (a step inside an argument) holds because the argument keeps its sort,
and the `Subst` cases are vacuous: a well-sorted term has no `Subst` node. The top-level hypothesis is
exactly base-contraction preservation, supplied by `subjectReduction_base` for well-sorted rules. -/

/-! ## A worked instance: recursive subject reduction with a variable rule

`srPres` declares a sort `T`, a constant `a`, and two unary symbols `f`, `g`, with the rewrite
`(f x) ~> (g x)` carrying a real pattern variable `x : T`. Reducing the ground term `(f a)` binds
`x` to `a` and produces `(g a)`; `subjectReduction_sr` is the machine-checked statement that the result
is well-sorted at `T`, obtained from `subjectReduction_base` (so every subterm keeps its declared sort
across the variable-instantiating step). -/
