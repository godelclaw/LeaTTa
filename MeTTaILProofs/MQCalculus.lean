Module: MeTTaILProofs.MQCalculus
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: The semantic core of the mq-calculus of Stay and Meredith, whose driving idea is
  "communication = measurement": when a quantum state is sent on a channel and received, it is
  measured in the computational basis and the receiver's continuations are weighted by the Born rule.
  We formalize what makes the COMM rule well-defined. A finite quantum state is a normalized vector
  of complex amplitudes, the Born probability of an outcome is the squared modulus of its amplitude,
  and these probabilities form a genuine distribution (in [0,1] and summing to one), so
  measurement-by-communication neither creates nor destroys probability. We also record interference:
  Born probabilities of a superposition are not the classical sum.

/-- A finite quantum state: complex amplitudes over an `n`-element computational basis, normalized so
    that the squared moduli sum to one (the Born normalization). In the mq-calculus this is the qubit
    register communicated on a channel; receiving it is a measurement. -/
structure QState (n : ℕ) where
  amp : Fin n → ℂ
  normalized : ∑ i, Complex.normSq (amp i) = 1

/-- The Born-rule probability of measuring basis outcome `i`: the squared modulus of its amplitude.
    The mq-calculus COMM rule weights the continuation for outcome `i` by this number. -/
def bornProb (i : Fin n) : ℝ := Complex.normSq (s.amp i)

/-- Every Born probability is nonnegative. -/
theorem bornProb_nonneg (i : Fin n) : 0 ≤ s.bornProb i := Complex.normSq_nonneg _

/-- Probability conservation: the Born probabilities of all outcomes sum to one. So measurement-by-
    communication yields a genuine probability distribution over continuations; the mq-calculus COMM
    rule neither creates nor destroys probability. -/
theorem bornProb_sum : ∑ i, s.bornProb i = 1 := s.normalized

/-- Every Born probability is at most one. -/
theorem bornProb_le_one (i : Fin n) : s.bornProb i ≤ 1 := by
  have h := Finset.single_le_sum (f := s.bornProb)
    (fun j _ => s.bornProb_nonneg j) (Finset.mem_univ i)
  rwa [s.bornProb_sum] at h

end QState

/-- Quantum interference: the Born probability of a superposition is not the sum of the Born
    probabilities of its parts (squared moduli do not add). This is why receiving an interfered state
    differs from receiving a classical mixture of the parts. -/

    ∃ a b : ℂ, Complex.normSq (a + b) ≠ Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b := by
