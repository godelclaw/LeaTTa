Module: MeTTaILProofs.MatcherCorrect
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: Correctness of the runtime matcher: a successful match produces a substitution that reconstructs
  the matched term. The headline `matchPat_inst_eq` proves `matchPat lhs t [] = some bnds → inst bnds lhs = t`
  for the rewriting fragment (subst-free patterns). This certifies that the reduction relation only encodes
  genuine rule applications: a base step `t ~> inst bnds rhs` really does fire `lhs ~> rhs` at a substitution
  with `t = inst bnds lhs`. The repeated-variable case is exactly the re-check that MORK's Verus proofs
  validate (`BindingEnv`: re-binding the same value is a no-op, a conflict is rejected; `VarRefRecheck`: the
  equality re-check of an already-bound variable is sound), here justified by the matcher's consistency test
  `t' == t`. Supporting: matcher monotonicity (matching only extends the bindings), coverage (every pattern
  variable ends up bound), and `inst_agree` (instantiation depends only on the pattern's variables).
Imports: MeTTaILProofs.SubjectReduction (varsOf, bndLookup, the matcher inversions), MeTTaILProofs.DecEq
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: SubstFree, inst_agree, matchPat_mono_sf, matchPat_cover_sf, matchPat_inst_eq
Open obligations: the `Subst`/binder fragment (where `inst` resolves a substitution rather than matching
  structurally) is out of scope, as for the rest of the first-order layer.

  /-- Well-sorted terms are subst-free. The sort discipline (`WellSorted` has only `var` and `sexp` cases,
      no `Subst` rule) rejects every `Subst` node, so a `Subst` term is never well-sorted. Hence the
      subst-free fragment on which matcher correctness and the critical-pair confluence are stated coincides
      with the well-sorted-TERM fragment.

      Scope, stated honestly: this does NOT by itself cover rules whose right-hand side is a `Subst` (for
      example the rho-calculus COMM rule in `MeTTaILTests/Rholang.lean`, whose RHS is `.subst ...`). Such a
      rule's RHS is not well-sorted as written, and its reduct becomes subst-free only after `inst` resolves
      the `Subst`. Subject reduction THROUGH that explicit-substitution resolution is a separate obligation
      (the binder fragment), not discharged by this lemma. So this closes the first-order rewriting fragment,
      not the binder fragment. -/

/-! ### The runtime step is a genuine rule application

The matcher correctness certifies the runtime: when `applyBaseRewrite` fires a (subst-free) base rule on a
term, the result really is the rule's right side instantiated at a substitution whose action on the left
side gives back the original term. So `t ~> t'` genuinely instances `lhs ~> rhs`. -/

    `t = lhs·bnds` and `t' = rhs·bnds`. -/

/-! ### Matcher completeness: the matcher finds every instance

The dual of `matchPat_inst_eq`: the matcher never misses a match. This mirrors the completeness half of
MORK's `VarRefRecheck` (the re-check is sound and, under the right groundness, complete). Here completeness
is unconditional, because a substitution is a function, so a pattern's instance has equal subterms at a
repeated variable's positions and the consistency test always passes. -/
