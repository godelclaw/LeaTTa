Module: MeTTaILProofs.SortSoundness
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: Discharging the `SortPreserving` side-condition of `Semantics/Sorts`. That module proves head-sort
  preservation under reduction *given* that every base reduction keeps the head category; here we show
  that hypothesis follows from a checkable condition on the rules and instantiate it on a concrete
  presentation, so the head-sort preservation chain is no longer an uninstantiated schema. The key step is
  the matcher head-inversion `matchPat_sexp_head` (a match against a constructor-headed pattern forces the
  same head), which needs `LawfulBEq Label` from `MeTTaILProofs/DecEq` to read the matcher's `==`. With
  the right-hand-side half already in `Sorts` (`headCat_inst_sexp`), `sortPreserving_of_rulesHeadCatOk`
  gives `SortPreserving` from the per-rule head-category check `RulesHeadCatOk`, which is exactly what the
  elaborator's `checkRewrite` enforces. `demoPres` is a worked presentation with populated `terms`, proven
  `SortPreserving`, with `eval` shown to keep a concrete reduction at its sort.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Sorts, MeTTaIL.Semantics.Relation (Reduces), MeTTaILProofs.DecEq (LawfulBEq)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: matchPat_sexp_head, headCat_of_matchPat, RulesHeadCatOk, sortPreserving_of_rulesHeadCatOk,
  demoPres, sortPreserving_demoPres
Open obligations: a recursive all-subterms well-sortedness still needs the full substitution lemma.

/-! ## A worked instance: head-sort preservation on a concrete presentation

`demoPres` declares a sort `T`, the constants `a`, `b`, and a unary `f`, with the single rewrite
`(f a) ~> b`. Its `terms` give every operator the category `T`, so the rule keeps the head category, and
`SortPreserving demoPres` follows from the criterion. -/
