Module: MeTTaILProofs.OSLFRec
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: The recursive (greatest-fixed-point) modalities of the OSLF spatial-behavioral logic. Stay and
  Meredith write the confinement and liveness formulae of "Logic as a Distributive Law" with a `mu X. P[X]`
  binder that they interpret as the GREATEST fixed point. The interpretation of a formula is a predicate
  on terms (`Pred = AST -> Prop`), which is a complete lattice, so the greatest fixed point of a monotone
  formula operator exists by Knaster-Tarski (Mathlib's `OrderHom.gfp`). `nu` is that modality, with the
  fixpoint equation `nu_unfold` and the coinduction principle `le_nu` (to show a property is below `nu F`,
  show it is `F`-consistent). The canonical instance is `alwaysBox`, the invariance/safety modality
  `nu X. A and box X` ("A holds now and after every reduction, forever"), the gfp shape behind
  confinement: `alwaysBox_le` (it implies `A` now), `alwaysBox_coind` (prove an invariant by exhibiting a
  reduction-closed witness), and `alwaysBox_preserved` (it is kept by the runtime, the coinductive
  analogue of `box_preserved`). This is the greatest-fixed-point layer left open by `Semantics/OSLF`.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.OSLF (Pred and its modalities), Mathlib.Order.FixedPoints (OrderHom.gfp)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: box_mono, nu, nu_unfold, le_nu, alwaysBox, alwaysBox_unfold, alwaysBox_le,
  alwaysBox_coind, alwaysBox_preserved
Open obligations: the full 2-categorical distributive-law derivation remains future work.
