Module: MeTTaILProofs.Unify
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: First-order syntactic unification over `FOTerm`, the decision procedure behind critical pairs. This
  is the computational layer that compromise #3 needs: it lets the abstract critical-pair condition `CPJ`
  (in `CriticalPairs`) be turned into an effective syntactic check, by unifying the left-hand sides of two
  rules at a non-variable position. This file builds the algorithm (Robinson / Martelli-Montanari, applying
  bindings eagerly with substitution composition) and proves it sound: a returned substitution really does
  unify every input equation. Completeness and most-generality, and the critical-pair construction on top,
  follow in later steps.
Imports: MeTTaILProofs.CriticalPairs (FOTerm, subst, substList)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: substComp, subst_comp, single, occurs, unify, unify_sound
Open obligations: completeness (unifiable terms unify), most-generality (any unifier factors through the
  result), and the resulting effective critical-pair check are not yet proved here.
