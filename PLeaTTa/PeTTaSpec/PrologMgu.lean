The resolver needs more than an existential statement that some substitution
works.  This module specifies the ordered Robinson-style choices themselves:
reflexivity first, then left-variable elimination, then right-variable
elimination, then rigid-node decomposition from left to right.  It is stated
over the canonical tree algebra, so proper/dotted list presentation cannot
change the result.

The finite-tree occurs check is explicit.  SWI's rational-tree extension is
therefore outside this certified local fragment rather than silently folded
into it.
