Module: CordialMiners.Extract.MettaIL
Layer: Extract
Purpose: Extraction of the coarse protocol facts to MeTTaIL atoms, and the proof that it loses nothing.
  encodeFact compiles each fact to an S-expression (a head symbol plus its encoded fields); decodeFact
  parses one back. The round-trip theorem extract_decode_encode shows that decoding an encoded fact
  recovers it exactly, given left-inverse field codecs. Extraction is therefore lossless: every coarse
  fact has a faithful MeTTaIL image that the parser maps back to the original.
Imports: CordialMiners.CMIR.Atom, CordialMiners.Trec.Syntax
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: encodeFact, decodeFact, extract_decode_encode
