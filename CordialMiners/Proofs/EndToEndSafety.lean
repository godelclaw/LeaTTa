Module: CordialMiners.Proofs.EndToEndSafety
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: The top-level safety statement (the blueprint's Theorem 4.54 core). It composes the verified
  component results into one guarantee: under snapshot well-formedness, the Byzantine-weight bound, and
  honest non-equivocation, PoR-weighted Cordial Miners is safe. threshold_certificates_agree is the
  positive Byzantine-agreement form of CERT-06: all valid certificates carry the same value.
  end_to_end_safety_of_output_monotone bundles leader-agreement (FL-07), output consistency (TAU-09),
  and blocklace integrity (BL-02) as EndToEndSafety. topoSort_valid certifies that the concrete
  deterministic ordering is a dup-free topological enumeration of exactly its input, so the
  deterministic-ordering obligation is discharged by a real algorithm.
Imports: CordialMiners.Spec.FinalLeader, CordialMiners.Spec.TauOrderSpec, CordialMiners.Ref.TauOrder
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved; rests only on the human-reviewed specs it composes)
Main exports: EndToEndSafety, EndToEndAssumptions, threshold_certificates_agree,
  end_to_end_safety_of_output_monotone, end_to_end_safety_of_anchor_prefix_monotone,
  end_to_end_safety_of_finalized_count_monotone, end_to_end_safety_of_finality_permanence,
  topoSort_valid
Open obligations: the ordering hypothesis is discharged in stages.
  end_to_end_safety_of_output_monotone takes abstract OutputMonotone;
  end_to_end_safety_of_anchor_prefix_monotone derives it from AnchorPrefixMonotone (TAU-08);
  end_to_end_safety_of_finalized_count_monotone derives that from the scalar fact that the finalized-wave
  count is monotone; end_to_end_safety_of_finality_permanence derives even that from finality permanence
  (a finalized wave stays finalized as the blocklace grows). The safety story then rests on three named
  facts: the Byzantine-weight bound, honest non-equivocation, and finality permanence. Liveness
  (dissemination completeness, scheduler non-starvation) is conditional on the network and scheduler
  fairness assumptions stated in the dissemination and scheduler specs.

/-- End-to-end safety (Theorem 4.54 core). Under the standard assumptions the protocol guarantees, in
    one statement:
    (1) leader-agreement: no two valid ratification certificates ratify conflicting target blocks;
    (2) output consistency: correct miners whose blocklaces sit inside a common limit produce
        prefix-comparable orders, so they never publish a conflicting position;
    (3) blocklace integrity: dissemination's receive-path preserves parent closure.
    The ordering's prefix-monotonicity (leader safety) enters as the hypothesis `hmono`, matching the
    blueprint's leader-safety trusted boundary. -/

/-- The concrete deterministic ordering is a valid total order of its input: it is duplicate-free,
    topologically sorted (no dependency after its dependent), and (under the strict-rank acyclicity
    hypothesis) enumerates exactly the input vertices. With determinism (topoSort is a function), the
    deterministic-ordering requirement is met by a real, computable algorithm. -/

/-- End-to-end safety with the ordering hypothesis discharged. Same guarantee as
    end_to_end_safety_of_output_monotone,
    but for the concrete anchored ordering and assuming only the primitive leader-safety fact: the
    finalized-anchor sequence is prefix-monotone in the blocklace. Output-prefix monotonicity (TAU-08)
    is now derived (tau_08_anchored_output_monotone), not assumed, so the only ordering input is
    AnchorPrefixMonotone, which is much closer to the protocol than abstract OutputMonotone. -/

    (tau_08_anchored_output_monotone anchors hist hLead)

/-- The deepest form: end-to-end safety with a fully concrete ordering and the ordering hypothesis
    reduced to one scalar fact. The ordering is the anchored order over the finalized-anchor sequence,
    and the only ordering input is that the finalized-wave count `finalCount` is monotone in the
    blocklace (finality permanence plus wave-ordered finalization). Anchor prefix-monotonicity and
    output-prefix monotonicity are both derived. -/

  end_to_end_safety_of_anchor_prefix_monotone S L honest h
    (finalizedAnchors finalCount leaderOf) hist
    (finalizedAnchors_prefixMonotone finalCount leaderOf hCount)

/-- The final form: PoR-weighted Cordial Miners is safe, resting on three named facts. Given the
    Byzantine-weight bound (hByz), honest non-equivocation (hNoEquiv), and finality permanence (hperm:
    a finalized wave stays finalized as the blocklace grows), the protocol guarantees leader-agreement,
    output consistency, and blocklace integrity, for the fully concrete finalized-anchor ordering. The
    bound monotonicity (hbound) is a technical artifact satisfied by the block count. Every other
    ordering property (the finalized-wave count's monotonicity, anchor prefix-monotonicity, and
    output-prefix monotonicity) is derived. -/
