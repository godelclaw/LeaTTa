Module: CordialMiners.Foundation.Prefix
Layer: Foundation
Purpose: Sequence-prefix theory for ordered consensus output. The deterministic ordering function
  must only ever extend the previously published prefix (the output-prefix discipline, IC10), and two
  correct miners whose outputs are prefixes of a common limit ordering must never disagree. Both rest
  on the prefix order being a partial order with comparable common prefixes. Built on Mathlib's
  `List.IsPrefix` (notation `<+:`).

theorem found_08_prefix_trans {l₁ l₂ l₃ : List α} (h₁ : l₁ <+: l₂) (h₂ : l₂ <+: l₃) :
    l₁ <+: l₃ := h₁.trans h₂

/-- FOUND-08 (antisymmetry up to equality): mutual prefixes are equal. Proved from lengths so it does
    not depend on the exact name of a core antisymmetry lemma. -/
theorem found_08_prefix_antisymm {l₁ l₂ : List α} (h₁ : l₁ <+: l₂) (h₂ : l₂ <+: l₁) :
    l₁ = l₂ := by

/-- FOUND-08 (comparability): two prefixes of a common sequence are themselves prefix-comparable. This
    is the core of output stability: if two correct miners' ordered outputs are each a prefix of the
    same limit ordering, then one output is a prefix of the other, so they never disagree on a
    published position. -/
theorem found_08_prefix_comparable {l₁ l₂ l : List α} (h₁ : l₁ <+: l) (h₂ : l₂ <+: l) :
