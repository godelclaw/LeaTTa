Purpose: Weighted finite sets and the weighted-overlap safety arithmetic. This is the mathematical
  core of PoR-weighted threshold finality: two threshold-heavy committee subsets must overlap in
  weight, which is what forces an honest signer into any pair of conflicting certificates.

variable {P : Type*}

/-- The total weight of a finite participant set under a weight function. The PoR analogue of "how
    many signers", weighted by reputation. -/
def wt (w : P → Weight) (A : Finset P) : Weight := ∑ p ∈ A, w p

/-- A weighted set of total weight `R` crosses the threshold `θ` of committee weight `W`. Stated by
    cross-product so the check stays in `ℕ`: `θ.num * W < R * θ.den` reads as `R / W > θ.num / θ.den`. -/
def thresholdPassed (R W : Weight) (θ : Ratio) : Prop := θ.num * W < R * θ.den

/-- The decidable Boolean form of `thresholdPassed`, for executable reducers. -/
def thresholdPassedBool (R W : Weight) (θ : Ratio) : Bool := decide (θ.num * W < R * θ.den)

/-- Obligation D.3: the Boolean threshold check reflects the propositional one. -/
theorem thresholdPassedBool_iff (R W : Weight) (θ : Ratio) :
    thresholdPassedBool R W θ = true ↔ thresholdPassed R W θ := by
  simp [thresholdPassedBool, thresholdPassed]

/-- FOUND-03: total weight is monotone in the set. -/
theorem found_03_weight_mono (w : P → Weight) {A B : Finset P} (h : A ⊆ B) :
    wt w A ≤ wt w B := by
  simp only [wt]; exact Finset.sum_le_sum_of_subset h

/-- FOUND-04: weighted inclusion-exclusion, stated additively so it stays in `ℕ` with no subtraction. -/
theorem found_04_weight_inclusion_exclusion [DecidableEq P] (w : P → Weight) (A B : Finset P) :
    wt w (A ∪ B) + wt w (A ∩ B) = wt w A + wt w B := by
  simp only [wt]; exact Finset.sum_union_inter

/-- The pure linear-arithmetic core of the overlap lemma, over plain naturals. Factoring it out lets
    `omega` run on clean variables, free of the product terms it does not reliably atomize. -/
private theorem overlap_arith {a b c d e f : ℕ}

/-- FOUND-05: the weighted-overlap lemma, the heart of PoR threshold-finality safety. If two
    committee subsets `A` and `B` of `C` are each threshold-heavy for `θ`, their intersection carries
    more than `(2θ - 1)` of the committee weight. Stated Nat-safely as
    `2 (θ.num · W) < wt(A ∩ B) · θ.den + W · θ.den`, which is exactly `wt(A ∩ B) > (2θ - 1) W`. -/
