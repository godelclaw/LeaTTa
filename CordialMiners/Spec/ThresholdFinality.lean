Module: CordialMiners.Spec.ThresholdFinality
Layer: Spec
Purpose: Self-enforcing threshold finality. The crown-jewel safety theorem CERT-06: under the
  Byzantine-weight bound and honest non-equivocation, two valid threshold certificates cannot carry
  conflicting values. This is where the weighted-overlap lemma pays off: the overlap of two heavy
  signer sets is heavier than the adversary bound, so it must contain an honest signer, who would then
  have approved both conflicting values.

/-- CERT-06 (no conflicting threshold finals). Under honest non-equivocation and the Byzantine-weight
    bound `S.ByzBound honest`, two valid threshold certificates for the same snapshot cannot carry
    conflicting (distinct) values. Threshold finality is therefore self-enforcing: it needs no health
    assumption, only the adversary bound and that honest members do not sign two values. -/
