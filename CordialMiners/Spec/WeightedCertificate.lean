Module: CordialMiners.Spec.WeightedCertificate
Layer: Spec
Purpose: Weighted threshold certificates and their validity, plus the certificate-level overlap lemma
  CERT-05 (two threshold-heavy signer sets overlap beyond the adversary bound), the restatement of the
  foundational weighted-overlap lemma for snapshots.
Imports: CordialMiners.Spec.Snapshot
Trusted boundary: human-reviewed spec
Main exports: ThresholdCert, ValidCert, cert_05_heavy_overlap

/-- A weighted threshold certificate for a candidate value: the value and the set of signers. The
    cryptographic evidence (one approval signature per signer) is abstracted into the `approved`
    predicate of `ValidCert`; the weight argument is what the safety proof turns on. -/
structure ThresholdCert (P V : Type*) where
  value : V

/-- A certificate is valid for a snapshot and an approval relation when its signer set is
    threshold-heavy and every signer approved the certificate's value. -/

/-- CERT-05: two threshold-heavy signer sets overlap beyond `(2θ − 1)W` of the committee weight. The
    snapshot-level restatement of `FOUND-05`, the basis of no-conflicting-finals. -/
